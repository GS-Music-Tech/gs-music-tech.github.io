Here is the third iteration of a feedback machine we are creating in the ensemble. stem. Here we add ourselves as performers into the feedback syThe notion is to create feedback loops of control data and audio to create a system that opens many parameters for compositional / improvisational control. Total control of the system should remain just out of reach.

This system gets rid of the:
<br> 
Yamaha DX7 <br>
Guitar Rig 6 plugin <br>

We keep the: <br>
MoogerFooger Delay <br>
Electrocomp EML 200 analog synthesizer <br>

We add:<br>
Guitar amplifier w/ effects
MoogerFooger Filter
TC Electronics Voice Processor
Electric Bass guitar
Electric Guitar
Tempest Drum Machine
Max patch that tracks pitch and amplitude and triggers Kontakte samples via the Kinetic Toys plugin



Routing Path:
Electrocomp: 
- It has Two VCO Loop among each other.
- The Master Oscillator Square Wave goes to the Input of VCO 1 and the Sine Wave goes to the Input of VCO 2.
- The Output goes to the MoogerFooger Delay Time parameter.

MoogerFooger Delay:
- It has is own LFO but we have to put the amount to 0.
