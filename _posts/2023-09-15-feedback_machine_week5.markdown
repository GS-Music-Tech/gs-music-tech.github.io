We spent some time developing what we needed to recreate the Fontana Mix score. We were able to find some transparencies and to make the necessary graphics using gimp. Here is the latest gimp file:

We are using the Fontana Mix to assemble time and parameter values to organize the composition of our system. Values derived from the process are stored in spreadsheets. These spreadsheets will then be turned into notated parts. The parts will eventually be merged into a single score. 

It was quite interesting to work out exactly how this would be done. The constraints will hopefully prove useful. We are excited to hear the result.
